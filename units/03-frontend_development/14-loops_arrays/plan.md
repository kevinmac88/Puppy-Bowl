Focus on loops. The guided practice will cover arrays in-depth.

While Loop

- initialization, condition, afterthought
- `+=` syntactic sugar
- for loop = syntactic sugar

Debugger

- breakpoint, `debugger`
- watch variables
- step through loop with debugger

## Guided Practice

This will take at least 1.5 hours! Leave plenty of time for students to complete the questions and functions.

## Workshop

Students should be referencing the Guided Practice solution, especially the optional challenge functions! Remind them that it's encouraged and expected for them to look at the answers. This workshop can be extremely difficult for students to start from scratch.

The rubric contains hints for how to approach each function. Students can still get credit for using the right techniques, even if they don't get the answer completely correct.
