# Block 13 | Conditionals and Functions | Plan

## Lesson

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fl3sov-N6gNXpxPvAeaRi-052-UDlF2j3i4BN8vk4FM/edit?usp=sharing)

Start with concepts in `notes.md`.

- Conditionals
  - boolean expressions
  - logical operators: `&&`, `||`, `!`
  - comparison operators: `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `===`, `!==`
  - conditional statements: `if`, `else if`, `else`

Then pivot to live code. Make sure to cover everything students will need to know in order to do the guided practice!

- Functions
  - declaration vs call / invoke
  - parameter, argument, return
  - `console.log` vs return
- `prompt`, `alert`

> [!NOTE]
>
> Arrow functions will be covered in an upcoming block.
> Stick with `function` syntax for now since the keyword is easier for
> beginner students to remember. Students also won't have to worry about hoisting.

## Guided Practice

- Split students into smaller groups of 3-4. There isn't quite enough code to write for pair programming.
- Introduces JS Doc
- Make sure students have access to demo code for reference.
- Leave plenty of time to go over this guided practice!

## Workshop

Essentially identical to the guided practice. Students will be writing the logic from scratch.
