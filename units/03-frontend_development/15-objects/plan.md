# Block 15 | Objects | Plan

## Review

Go over the solution to Workshop: Stats. Historically a very difficult topic.
Cover the provided starter code at the bottom - especially `split` and `parseInt`

Feel free to take more time to review if necessary. This lesson goes quickly if students have a solid understanding of loops and arrays.

## Lesson

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_TPUjPDa-wdBGM2QGskPXqVcYE3bWGoQeqclz5VwPgY)

Nested Arrays

- quick example to motivate objects

Objects

- definitions: key, value, shape
- access: dot vs bracket notation, `in`
- `Object.keys`, `Object.values`
- mutation, insertion, deletion
- iteration with `for..in`
- JSON: stringify and parse

## Guided Practice

Relatively quick. Students write a function that sums all the values of an object.

## Workshop

Main objective is to calculate a frequency table from array of strings.

Students should be referencing past solutions! Students will need to know how to use `split`, since they are starting from scratch.

`console.table` can be nice but not necessary.
