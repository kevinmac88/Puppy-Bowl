# Block 16 | Array Methods | Plan

## Review

Go over Froyo workshop. Students should be comfortable writing the solution on their own.

## Lesson

### Functional Programming

- Functions are first-class.
- function expression, anonymous function, arrow function syntax
- Higher-order functions
  - pass function as argument
  - return a function

### Array Methods

Split students into small groups and give them 20 minutes. Assign half the groups to write `map`. Assign the other half to write `filter`. They should use loops, not the array method.

Regroup and go over. Then cover:

- reduce
- forEach vs map
- find vs filter

## Guided Practice

Pair programming. Students have to use `map`, `find`, `filter`, and `reduce`.
`Sort` is introduced as optional extension.

Students might struggle with the new syntax, so walk them through `map` if necessary.

Go over before starting workshop!

## Workshop

Introduce JSDoc typedefs. Otherwise very similar to guided practice: array methods on array of objects.
