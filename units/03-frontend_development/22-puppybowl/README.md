## Looking Ahead

To prepare for Unit 3, read the following chapters of the [React Textbook](https://react.dev/learn):

- https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component
- https://react.dev/learn/importing-and-exporting-components
- https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx
- https://react.dev/learn/javascript-in-jsx-with-curly-braces
- https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists
- https://react.dev/learn/understanding-your-ui-as-a-tree

We will be switching to Node as our main runtime environment, so make sure `node -v` returns a version number!
