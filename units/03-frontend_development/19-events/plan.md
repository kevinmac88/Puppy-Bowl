## Lesson

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YQh9Tz0XWrttTRPh7mKNj0TD-w9bKq5hpgkXNnlY1wk/edit?usp=sharing)

Live code the [Sentence Builder demo](notes/index.js).

- writing functions to change state and rerender
- `submit` event listener to add element to state array
- use `FormData` to grab values from a form
- `click` event listener to remove element from state array

## Guided Practice | Counting Sheep

Pair programming. Students get a lot of starter code. Make sure they read it, or read it together with them.

Leave enough time to go over the solution together. Students will need to reference it to do the workshop.

## Workshop | Odds and Events

[Link](https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/odds-and-events)

Combines concepts from live demo and guided practice. Form submission to add number into state array. Buttons to move numbers from one state array to another. Reuse components to render state arrays.
