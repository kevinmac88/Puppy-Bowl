# Block 4 | HTML

# Plan

## Morning Review

Make sure students at the very least know how to make a repo, clone it down, and push their changes back up (ideally using feature branches).

## Lesson | HTML

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12z_GGNxn9tTRuG4uG2teiwVdsR9OF2RhNK4ujWuWLKE/edit?usp=sharing)

Conceptual:

- browser parses HTML file to render a document
- markup vs programming language
- syntax vs semantics
- nesting tags; parent, child
- tags, attributes

## Guided Practice | HTML Intro

[Link](https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/Unit1.HTMLIntro)

- mostly vocab questions with example HTML to ease students into reading & writing HTML

## Live Code

- live serve HTML file
- HTML skeleton, simple tags
- image with alt text
- semantic elements
- read documentation: [MDN HTML element reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)

## Workshop

[Link](https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/Unit1.Zoo)

- Walk students through how to submit a GitHub repo link (instead of uploading files to Canvas)
- Make sure students are creating **public** repos! We don't have access to private repos and cannot grade them.
- Remind students that they have to **push** their changes.
