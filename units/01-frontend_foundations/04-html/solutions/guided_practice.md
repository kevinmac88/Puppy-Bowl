# HTML Intro

[Questions](https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/Unit1.HTMLIntro)

## Reading HTML

1. `h1`
2. `p`
3. `<open>` and `</close>` (closing tag has `/`)
4. The HTML is:
   1. `<h1>Breaking news!</h1>`
   2. `<h2>Important documents leaked</h2>`
   3. `<title>You'll never believe what you read</title>`
   4. `<strong>anonymous dentist</strong>`
   5. `<em>recommended toothpaste</em>`
5. `body`
6. `h1`, `h2`, and `p`
7. Child elements are indented within their parent.
8. The first line is incorrect. Tags have to open and close in a way that they are either inside or outside one another. In other words, tags must be closed in the reverse order from which they are opened. They cannot overlap.

## Headings

1. jaguar
2. A heading is a title or label of some content, whereas a paragraph is the content itself.
3. Ecological role, Hunting and diet, Social activity
4. `h1` is the most important level.
5. `h5`

## Lists

1. Ingredients should be mixed _after_ preheating the oven.
2. The order matters in an ordered list, whereas it does not matter in an unordered list. Ordered lists are usually numbered. Unordered lists are usually bullets.
3. `ul`
4. `ol` is more appropriate because the order of the steps when baking is important.
5. Examples:
   1. `ol`: list of chapters in a book
   2. `ul`: list of books on a shelf
6. There is no limit.
7. list item

## Images

1. Cody
2. Self-closing tags do not have a closing tag. Instead, there is a `/` before the closing `>` of the opening tag.
3. `https://learndotresources.s3.amazonaws.com/workshop/5b68692105739d0004e2cfd4/cody.jpg`
4. The `src` is a link to the image file that should be displayed.
