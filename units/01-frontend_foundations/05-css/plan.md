# Block 5 | CSS | Plan

## Morning Review

- Go over GitHub workflow of working w/ feature branches.
  - If feature branches are too overwhelming, students should at the very least be able to work directly on `main`
- Remind students about `pwd` and `cd`; very common mistake is that the terminal is in the wrong folder!

## Workshop | Furniture Emporium

[Link](https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/Unit1.FurnitureEmporium)

This is the first truly open-ended workshop for students. The HTML is already written for them, but they will have to add classes and write CSS from scratch to style product cards for a fake furniture store. They don't need to deal with images: mostly just text styling and box model (margin, border, padding etc).
