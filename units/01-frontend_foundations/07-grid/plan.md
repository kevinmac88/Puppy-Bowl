# Block 7 | Grid | Plan

## Morning Review

Students might still be working through Flex. Take a little bit longer to review if necessary. Grid conceptually is more straightforward, so time can be cut from the lesson.

- go over Bakery workshop
- how to use multiple css files

## Lesson

[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1r360dMv66pPTvD43mRkS33mPDjSP2eqLzLkCbl0SlFc/edit)

Keep the lesson brief; just enough for students to jump into the guided practice. Leave time at the end to go over guided practice concepts before workshop.

- grid concepts
  - tracks, lines
  - rows, columns, cells
  - grid container vs grid item
- media queries and breakpoints
- browser mobile inspector
- meta viewport tag in head, virtual viewport

## Guided Practice

[Guided Practice: Holy Grail](https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/Unit1.HolyGrail)

Group work. Very little code - mostly conceptual questions and playing around with grid properties. Students will have the Holy Grail layout built by the end.

## Workshop

[Workshop: Garden](https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/Unit1.Garden)

Workshop does not introduce anything new (except for the last optional level). Students use the same exact properties from the guided practice, so make sure students are good with those.
