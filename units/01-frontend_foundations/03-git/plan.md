- walks students through using a GitHub template, `clone`, `add`, `commit`, `status`, `log`, `push`

## Workshop | GitHub Workflow

[Link](https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/Unit1.GitHubWorkflow)

- Group work - students have to make PRs and resolve merge conflicts on the same repo
- Lots of steps but there are screenshots along the way so students should be able to follow
- This is the first time students will be submitting a repo link instead of screenshots, so make sure they know how to do that
