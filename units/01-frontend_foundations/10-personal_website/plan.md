# Block 10 | Personal Website

# Prep

- [ ] Use the [starter repo](https://github.com/FullstackAcademy/Unit1.PersonalWebsite) as a template to make a new repo for your cohort. Students should fork the new cohort-specific repository.
- [ ] Update Canvas to link to your cohort-specific repository.

# Plan

## Morning Review & Lesson

Should be quick. Make sure students have enough time to get started on the career simulation, especially since this is their first one.

- HTML forms with labeled inputs
- Link to other HTML files with `<a>`
- How to fork and PR a repo, since that's how you'll be grading student submissions

## Career Simulation

Students should work on the career simulation. Encourage them to still ask questions, but don't be as quick / generous with giving them answers. They can still go to open support web!
