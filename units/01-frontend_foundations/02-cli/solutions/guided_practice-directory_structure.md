# Directory Structure

## Files and Folders

1. `kitchen/`
2. `fridge/`
3. `pretzels.bag`, `chips.bag`, and `popcorn.bag`
4. `pretzels.bag` and `popcorn.bag`
5. `.bag` (or `bag`)
6. `/` at the end of the name
7. A file is a single piece of information. A folder is a container for files and other folders.

## Relative Paths

1. `pine.tree`
2. `tall_mountains/`
3. Go to `tall_mountains/`, then to the `dark_cave/`. You will see `earth.worm` there.
4. Go back to `town/`, then to `tall_mountains/`.
5. Go back to `tall_mountains/`, then back to `town/`.
6. The relative path is:
   1. `../tall_mountains`
   2. `../../great_forest/barn.owl`
   3. `tall_mountains/dark_cave/earth.worm`

## Absolute Paths

1. `/`
2. The absolute path is:
   1. `/photos/pets/`
   2. `/music/theme_song.mp3`
   3. `/documents/tax/1040.pdf`
   4. `/desktop/coursework/`
3. `/` at the front of the path
4. No. Absolute paths are always the same regardless of where you are.
5. Relative paths change depending on where you are. So the same relative path (e.g. `../../`) could point to two completely different files or folders.
6. `photos`, `music`, `documents`
7. The relative path is:
   1. `../../desktop/coursework`
   2. `../../photos/pets`
   3. `pets/cat_napping.jpg`
   4. `../documents/tax/1040.pdf`
   5. `../desktop/coursework/block01/README.md`
