# JavaScript Basics

An **expression** is a sequence of **operators** and **operands** that **evaluate** to a single **value**.

A **statement** is a complete sentence in JavaScript. It usually involves one or more expressions.

A **variable** is a named **pointer** to a **memory address**, at which a **value** is stored.

A variable IS NOT the value stored in the variable.
A variable is the box. The value is the thing inside the box.
Every value has a **type**, which determines how the binary should be interpreted.

The **primitive types** to know in JS are:

- number: `5`, `-3`, `0.28`
- string: `"pie"`, `"Hello 123"`, `"ðŸŽƒ"`
- boolean: `true` or `false`
- undefined: currently the variable is empty, but potentially we could put something there
- null: intentional the absence of data
